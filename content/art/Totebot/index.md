description = "A drawing of a Totebot from the game Scrap Mechanic running towards the camera with its 3 spider-like mechanical legs. It is a hostile robot with red glowing eyes wires hanging from the top of its head. It is mostly khaki colored with some black and grey spots. The Totebot is casting a shadow on a picture if a night scene with a pathway, a bench, streetlights and two creepy headlights in the distance. Everything is in a dark cyan night setting."
