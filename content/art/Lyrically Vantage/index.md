I found this song in the list of songs I started and then I started to complete it. It also led to me making a Nix flake to reproducibly and automatically build this song from the LMMS file and the Blender cover art file.

It's a slow instrumental song made purely with digital instruments including a choir, a cathedral organ and a fantasy bell piano. The song is a bit heavy and dramatic but also playful.
