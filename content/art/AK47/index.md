description = "A low polygon AK47 is surrounded by wavy light-blue glowing lines. Beneath all the previous is a concrete tile floor with lots of tiny hills. The camera is pointing at the gun so that you can see the background above the floor. The background is a gradient starting at the top with magenta and then going down to red and down to black."
