Without the PBR materials from ambientCG this would not look half as good. They're all licensed under CC0. With this piece I combined a bunch of stuff like modelling a PC and a whole bunch of other things with softbody and cloth simulations to make a nice room. I improved my compositing skills quite a bit too. All the work took several days though the time was probably greatly reduced by my *new* hardware like a better processor and graphics card.
