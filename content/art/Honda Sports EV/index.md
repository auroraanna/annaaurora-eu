description = "A futuristic electric sports car with light-pink glossy paint and some black surfaces. It is parked on an asphalt floor with white marble walls around it in the background. There are also some white marble pillars on the floor behind the car. The car is making a shadow in the bright white overhead light but the asphalt directly under the car is being lit brightly. The nose of the car has two headlights in the shape of a circle with two eye lids to the side. The nose also incorporates a blue glowing arrow in the middles, pointing down."

I modelled this car off the Honda Sports EV Concept from 2018.
