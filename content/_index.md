Hello,  
I am papojari.

Programming is my hobby: I design websites, develop games and write packages and my system configuration in Nix. I also do some code review of new or updated packages over at the [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls) repository.

I really dig Linux stuff. My current desktop operating system is [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). [Click here to see my whole Linux distro journey](linux-journey.md). I try to use as much open source software as viable.

[Occasionally I'll create something in Blender](http://127.0.0.1:1111/categories/3d-art/), a 3d software.

You can find my blog, my artwork and my online accounts on this website. I also put my [first game](/static/find-billy/) on this site.
