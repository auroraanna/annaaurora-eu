[This website](https://codeberg.org/papojari/pages) is built from [this repository](https://codeberg.org/papojari/papojari.codeberg.page). Therefore for some file's like SVGs or other images the license from the source repository carries over. Other files like HTML files for example have the license from the source repository and the license from the [theme repository](https://codeberg.org/papojari/merm/src/branch/main/LICENSE.md). It all depends on if the file was purely generated from the source repository or if the theme repository was used too.
