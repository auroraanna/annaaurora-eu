I find it so funny that when I try to design a logo for one of my programs I think about drawing something but *come on, too complex, especially as a small icon* (thinking to myself). Then I try a cool icon in inkscape but kinda give up because I feel like my creation has not enough character, like I just took some material icons and slapped them together (which I tried for my latest program actually). In the end, I always circle back to pixel art. I think it's because of the limitation pixel art gives you.
